# Vision Care Clinic

Vision Care Clinic is a comprehensive, full-stack web application designed to streamline the operations of an eye care facility. This application provides a robust platform for patients to explore various eye care services, book appointments, and manage their user profiles. For administrators, it offers tools to manage appointments and user data.

The project is built with a modern technology stack, featuring a Spring Boot backend for reliable API services and a React frontend for a responsive and interactive user experience. Security is paramount, with JWT-based authentication ensuring data integrity and privacy.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

*   **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 17 or higher.
*   **Node.js**: Version 18 or higher (LTS recommended).
*   **Docker & Docker Compose**: For running the PostgreSQL database.
*   **Git**: For version control.

---

## Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to get the application running locally.

### 1. Database Setup

The easiest way to spin up the database is using Docker Compose located in the `infra` directory.

1.  Navigate to the infrastructure directory:
    ```bash
    cd infra
    ```

2.  Start the PostgreSQL container:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
    This will start a PostgreSQL database listening on port `5432` with the following credentials (as defined in `docker-compose.yml`):
    *   **Database**: `visioncare`
    *   **User**: `admin`
    *   **Password**: `password`

### 2. Backend Setup

1.  Open a new terminal window and navigate to the backend directory:
    ```bash
    cd vision_care_clinic/backend
    ```

2.  (Optional) Configure Database Connection:
    If you changed the Docker credentials or are using a local PostgreSQL installation, update `src/main/resources/application.properties` with your database details.

3.  Build the project and install dependencies:
    ```bash
    ./mvnw clean install
    ```

4.  Run the Spring Boot application:
    ```bash
    ./mvnw spring-boot:run
    ```
    The backend server will start at `http://localhost:8080`.

### 3. Frontend Setup

1.  Open a third terminal window and navigate to the frontend directory:
    ```bash
    cd vision_care_clinic/frontend
    ```

2.  Install the Node dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The frontend application will start at `http://localhost:5173` (or another available port).

## Configuration

### Backend Configuration (`application.properties`)

The backend configuration is primarily handled in `src/main/resources/application.properties`. Key properties include:

*   `spring.datasource.url`: JDBC URL for the database.
*   `spring.datasource.username`: Database username.
*   `spring.datasource.password`: Database password.
*   `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto`: Database initialization strategy (e.g., `update`, `create-drop`).

### Environment Variables

For production environments, it is recommended to pass sensitive information via environment variables or system properties rather than hardcoding them in the properties file.

---

## Documentation

For more detailed information, please refer to the following guides located in the `docs/` directory:

*   **[API Reference](docs/API_REFERENCE.md)**: Detailed documentation of all backend REST API endpoints, including request/response examples.
*   **[Frontend Guide](docs/FRONTEND_GUIDE.md)**: Overview of the React application structure, components, routing, and internationalization.
*   **[Backend Guide](docs/BACKEND_GUIDE.md)**: Architecture details, database schema, security flow, and development guidelines for the Spring Boot backend.

### Quick API Overview

#### Authentication (`/api/auth`)
*   `POST /register`: Register a new user.
*   `POST /login`: Authenticate and receive a JWT.
*   `GET /me`: Get current user profile.

#### Appointments (`/api/appointments`)
*   `POST /book`: Book an appointment.
*   `GET /me`: Get my appointments.
